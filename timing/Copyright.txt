Note : This file, adapted from the original implementation, is intended to be easy to integrate to existing projects rather than to be "clean" or efficient. It is thus a single header file encompassing all the necessary classes, originally in multiple files. Many classes are present for the sole purpose of passing data to windows threads, which make the code even uglier.

// HISTORY:
// 
// 13/02/2012 : Fixed a bug when Nlevels==0. Bug not present in the submission.
// Fixed the helper function Slerp, not actually used here (does not compile if used).
// Fixed the Vector class when DIM==3 (does not compile if used)
// changed abs to fabs, since the only prototype for GCC seems int abs(int)
//
// 12/09/2011 : Cleaned up the submission source code. Known bug : the 
// provided example returns 0 when compiled with GCC
