The DisplacementInterpolation.cpp file is the toy example provided by the displacement interpolation paper site (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/tr/2011/DisplacementInterpolation/).  It has two sets of 50x50 data positions with weights and an additional 50x50 set of positions which will be used to determine the interpolated weights.

Several timing features have been added to the code to determine the processing time of both the precomputation and interpolation of the algorithm.  The times are saved as entries in a timing record file every time the program runs.

The Interpolator.h file has been rewritten with pthreads to allow multithreading on Ubuntu.  To account for changes in processing time, additional time checking will be implemented in the example code and the data uploaded soon.
