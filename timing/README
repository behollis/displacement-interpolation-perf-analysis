The DisplacementInterpolation.cpp file is the toy example provided by the displacement interpolation paper site (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/tr/2011/DisplacementInterpolation/).  It has two sets of 50x50 data positions with weights and an additional 50x50 set of positions which will be used to determine the interpolated weights.

Several timing features have been added to the code to determine the processing time of both the precomputation and interpolation of the algorithm.  The times are saved as entries in a timing record file every time the program runs.

Currently, any timing done on non-Windows platforms will be single-threaded and take noticeably more time.  The Interpolator.h file will be rewritten with pthreads very soon.
